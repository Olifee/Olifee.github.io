description: Running out of ideas for handcrafted calendars, I decided to go all nerdy and build a digital advents calendar to follow our annual christmas tradition. Every day, my boyfried would recieve a puzzle that he had to solve. The answer was then to be filled into the day's calendar page - if it matched, he would recieve a hint for the "final question", elsewise he would have to try again. The GUI was built with Javafx, and almost all texts were generated with random templates I created to make the app appear more dynamic. It was a lot of work, but definetely worth it!
