description: This is a Java implementation of the popular 2048 game, made from scratch. Through a fully object-oriented design  clear encapsulation is guaranteed, and modifications like changing the board-size can be made within seconds. The graphical user interface (GUI) was built with Javafx. The program can be executed platform-independently. View the [full source code on GitHub](https://github.com/Olifee/2048-game).
