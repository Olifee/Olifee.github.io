description: In this project I created a simplified version of Git, a very popular version management tool, from scratch. Via a GUI application built with Javafx, the user can choose a Git-repository from his file system. My programm will then parse the repository, identify all objects (trees, commits, blobs - no tags!) through their SHA1 hash and create a commit graph. The graph will be displayed in the GUI, where the user can click on commits to get further information like commit date, author and message.
