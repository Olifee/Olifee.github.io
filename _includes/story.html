                                    <p class="text-muted">I did my Abitur (German university entrance qualification) at "Schloss Hansenberg“, a public-private boarding school for gifted students from all over Germany. It was a great experience to live and learn with 63 other highly motivated students willing to share their passion for science, music, sports! or whatsoever. This way, I got involved with(into) the most varying activities: leading a charity project, organizing a „Stay sustainable day“, representing our class in the stundet council, doing politics at the European Youth Parliament and finally - you might have guess it - participating in a Computer Science contest without any programming skills. Finishing school as best female student, I was chosen valedictorian.</p>

German Computer Science Contest, I hab no clue about programming, algorithms or CS in general. Actually, all I had was some math and a stern will to learn. And indeed, I learned a lot: for the code documentation of my first submission, I copy & pasted all my code into MS Word and, surprised that it turned all black again, did manual syntax highlight. By the time I reached the national finals, not only did I use LaTeX (and automatic syntax highlight!) but also knew the in and outs of Pascal and Prolog (a really cool language, it’s a shame so little people use it today), but I could go all nerd on big-O stuff and sorting algorithms! My efforts got rewarded by a second prize and additional team prize for giving the best presentation. Also, my friend and I were invited to the „German day of talents“ in Berlin, a program by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research to honor students for outstanding achievements (check out my interview <a href="http://landespresseportal.de/berlin/item/24094-tag-der-talente-2014.html">here</a>).

I haven’t regretted my decision once. The university I chose has a research focus on human-computer-interaction, a topic I was very curious about. Also, they offer many courses on Machine learning stuff, which is definitely one of the most exciting topics of today’s CS! What I love most about being a student is the free access to all kinds of knowledge you get: you can learn the most different things on one campus! So far, I have taken law and economics courses, some seminars on comparative culture science and visited countless philosophy and medicine lectures. Expected graduation date is August 2018.</p>

As alumni, I now get the chance to give something back by volunteering to judge (tons of) contest submissions twice a year, participating in media campaigns and teaching kids to code at fairs like the IdeenExpo 2017 (see me in the official video <a href="https://youtu.be/jiMPZVN2WMw?t=15s">here</a>).</p>

Powered by a sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) engine combined with an extensive medical knowledge base, the international health tech startup develops products to support medical decision making, e.g. a personal health companion and telemedicine app. What I liked best about it is that they don’t aim to replace doctors but augment their role - which is desperately needed considering today’s workload of doctors! During my internship, I had the chance to create a web component that facilitates the access to anatomical information and displays correlations between body structures, which can then be used by doctors to better understand symptoms and diseases. I loved interning there, not only because of the typical startup atmosphere and a perfect view over Berlin Kreuzberg, but also because of the interdisciplinary work - doctors and developers would sit on the same desks, discussing all design decisions together! It was a great chance the think out-of-the-box and get a new perspective, while doing something that would really improve human life’s. My decision to later work in health tech is set :)</p>

After teaching two courses on „Digital Computer Systems“ with over forty students, I couldn’t agree more. Sure there are cooler things in life than XOR … and .., but the real challenge is to convince the audience otherwise! Every week, I joked and jumped around, widely scribbling on the chalkboard, just for this short glisten in their eyes when they would finally understand (well, and for my own sake, because I also had to grade their assignments and exams, and boy, some mistakes are so painful to see). But ridiculing myself payed of: the participation rate was over 95% and some students actually said they had fun (of course, the later could also be attributed to watching me get chalk all over my cloth rather then my entertaining way to present the boolean algebra).
