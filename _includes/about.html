                    <p class="text-muted">With 13 years I started to take university courses in Mathematics and earned my first credit points. 
                        Today, I'm a M.Sc. Computer Science student with focus on Machine Learning and its applications to healthcare problems.
                        After I finish my Masters degree in September 2019, I want to work as a Software Engineer and build things that matter.

                    <h4 class="service-heading">Experience</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">When I was 16, a friend of mine and I decided to learn coding in order to participate in a CS competition together. (Surprisingly,) we both made it to the National Finals (and both scored a second prize!), but I like to think that my coding has improved since then.
                        Through various interships - e.g. as Software Engineer in two healthcare start-up and as Research Assistant at the University of Cambridge - I could gather extensive work experience and boost my coding skills.
                        Now I am a proficient Java and Python developer, had a lot of fun with Prolog, fell in love with React.js, briefly met MatLab, R and some web languages, and still suffer from nightmares about a fromer VHDL/Assembler project.

                        <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x text-primary"></i>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">Passion</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">I firmly believe that being passionate about something is the real superpower humans can have: it's the root of our potential, the fire of our ideas, and the guide to where we belong.
                    I am lucky to have great passion for the things in my life, because gives me determination to accomplish what might seem impossible at first (a nice strength when debugging code).
                    It gives me the persistence to follow my many extracurricular interests - medicine, running, spending time with friends and travelling the world - despite studying full-time.
                   To me, the greatest joy is to share passion: I do it by teaching kids how to code, volunteering in clubs and running projects.
